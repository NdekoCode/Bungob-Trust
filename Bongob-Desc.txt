Welcome to Bongob Trust

Bongob Trust is about developing a model for people and communities to build peace and overcome poverty especially in rural Africa while adapting to an evolving climate  and world order

Developing a model that promotes peace and overcomes poverty

...... to promote peace and fight poverty......

Build a reproducible model that blends with local realities

We work to build an environmentally-friendly model that is: replicable ,  scalable and sustainable. 
One that.........

This model will provide a lasting solution to one of Africa's greatest socio-economic challenge; the agro-pastoral question. 

Indeed, over several decades, the cry of farmers whose crops are devoured by animals and wild fire has remained a pain in the ears and heads of leaders and governments across most of Africa.

We meet leaders, farmers and pastoralists and share with them the merits of this magic plant- the sisal plant

Getting the plant to you



We can deliver sisal seedlings to individuals and communities and guide them through the process of planting and growing of sisal either as life fences or for income generation and poverty alleviation.

We:
         - identify communities facing theagro-pastoral challenge,
         - educate them on effective solution with the sisal plant,
         - mobilise them to resolving their problem once and for all
